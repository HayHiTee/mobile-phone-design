As a developer in a consulting firm, you are to lead the development of mobile phone information. Information should ideally contain phone model, price, owner features, manufacturer, features of the battery(model, idle time and hours talk) and features of the screen (size and colors). Use your knowledge of OOP, properties and Class to develop these features.
Hint: Think about separating different features into different classes and check out composition vs inheritance
